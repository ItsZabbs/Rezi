## So what is this thing?
Glad you asked. Rezi is a Greek female name for "Gatherer" which I think suits this bot perfectly. Rezi is a functioning Discord bot that allows you to search and grab roms from the great internet. This bot also comes with anti piracy measures that you may choose to enable if you like, which will be explained later.

## What is supported?
Currently the bot can grab Switch, Wii, Playstation(mixed), and Xbox(mixed), and many Retro consoles. It can also have plugins added to be able to use more.

## How it works
Also glad you asked. This bot uses selenium to scrape certain sites to find links. It is automated and highly useful. And yeah, thats really it. There are a few more features that I will tell you about.

## Features
This bot includes little features but are very important: Rom searching, Rom downloading, Base64 conversion, multiple user interaction, and more.

## Anti-Piracy
If you so choose this bot can convert the links that it has grabbed to base64, making it so you can keep your server pure.

## How can I help?
Good question! If you would like to help you can either donate (helps me out a lot) or you can take these files and add your own sources to it! I also am allowing for plugins to be made; if that interests you please head to the [Rezi-Plugins Github](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/Rezi-Plugins). There you can make an issue and request to have your plugin submitted.
