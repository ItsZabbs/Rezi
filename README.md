# Rezi Bot
Rezi is a Greek female name for "Gatherer" which I think suits this bot perfectly. Rezi is a functioning Discord bot that allows you to search and grab roms from the great internet. If you prefer to use the website instead of a Discord interface, please go to [the Rezi website github](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/ReziWebsite) or [the website itself](https://rezi.one). It takes the already used links from the [Rezi.one](https://rezi.one) website, and it searches through it using the Meilisearch api, and then is served to you by discord.

# What games? Consoles?
Currently the bot can grab from [this list of links](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/ReziWebsite/wiki). This bot can grab from many consoles ranging from modern ones such as the switch or ps4, all the way back to the gameboy, and even older.

# Safety and piracy
If you so choose this bot can convert the links that it has grabbed to base64, making it so you can keep your server pure. That being said, Discord is very against piracy, so it is not guaranteed safety, but it is the best it can get. If you would rather use Rezi as a web interface, go to [Rezi.one](https://rezi.one).

# How can I help?
Good question! If you would like to help you can donate (helps me out a lot). This project is finished, and not much is really needed. If you want to fork it and continue it, then go right ahead.
