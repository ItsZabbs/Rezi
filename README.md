# Rezi Bot

*Latest Stable= v3.0.0 |
Latest Dev= v3.0.0*

## So what is this thing?
Rezi is a Greek female name for "Gatherer" which I think suits this bot perfectly. Rezi is a functioning Discord bot that allows you to search and grab roms from the great internet. If you prefer to use the website instead of a discord interface, please go to [the rezi website](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/ReziWebsite)

## What is supported?
Currently the bot can grab from [this list of links](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/ReziWebsite/wiki)

## How it works
It takes the already used links from the Rezi.one website, and it searches through it using Meilisearch, and then is served to you by discord.

## Safety
If you so choose this bot can convert the links that it has grabbed to base64, making it so you can keep your server pure.

## How can I help?
Good question! If you would like to help you can either donate (helps me out a lot) or you can take these files and add your own sources to it! I also am allowing for plugins to be made; if that interests you please head to the [Rezi-Plugins Github](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/Rezi-Plugins). There you can make an issue and request to have your plugin submitted.
