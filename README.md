# DiscordRomScraperBot


***This is still in development***


Hello everyone! This is a public repo and source for the Rom Scraper Discord Bot, kindof a stupid name, but gets the job done. In this Readme you will find all the commands needed to use this bot, contact info, donation info and more. 

## So what is this thing?
Glad you asked. This is a functioning Discord bot that allows you to search and grab roms from different sources of your choosing. I have the best ones in this repo for the bot to use and many more that will allow for customizability, and reliability. This bot also comes with anti piracy measures that you may choose to enable if you like, which will be explained later.

## What is supported?
Currently the bot can get links for Nintendo Switch (xci/nsp, user can choose), Wii (anti-piracy option will not work for this and gives a happy little error), WiiU, PS4, Xbox (original xbox, again no anti-piracy), Xbox 360, and hopefully more in the future!


## How it works
Also glad you asked. This bot uses selenium to scrape certain sites to find links. It is automated and highly useful. And yeah, thats really it. There are a few more features that I will tell you about.

## Features
This bot includes little features but are very important: Rom searching, Rom downloading, switching consoles, switching repos, anti-piracy, and more to come!

## Anti-Piracy
If you so choose this bot has 4 options for piracy. You may either choose to get direct download links, to get base64 conversions of that same link, or getting a link from the console's official store (if possible) that the user may buy the game from, or to get base64 conversions of the console's official store (if possible). The more official way will not work with older consoles
