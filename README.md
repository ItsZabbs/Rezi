# Rezi Bot

*Latest Version (4/6/2022) = v3.1.0*

## So what is this thing?
Rezi is a Greek female name for "Gatherer" which I think suits this bot perfectly. Rezi is a functioning Discord bot that allows you to search and grab roms from the great internet. If you prefer to use the website instead of a Discord interface, please go to [the Rezi website github](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/ReziWebsite) or [the website itself](https://rezi.one).

## What is supported?
Currently the bot can grab from [this list of links](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/ReziWebsite/wiki).

## How it works
It takes the already used links from the [Rezi.one](https://rezi.one) website, and it searches through it using the Meilisearch api, and then is served to you by discord.

## Safety
If you so choose this bot can convert the links that it has grabbed to base64, making it so you can keep your server pure. That being said, Discord is very against piracy, so it is not guaranteed safety, but it is the best it can get. If you would rather use Rezi as a web interface, go to [Rezi.one](https://rezi.one).

## How can I help?
Good question! If you would like to help you can donate (helps me out a lot). This project is finished, and not much is really needed. If you want to fork it and continue it, then go right ahead.
